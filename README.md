# Real-Time Shape Detection using OpenCV

This project aims to detect geometric shapes (e.g., square, rectangle, triangle, circle, etc.) in real-time using a laptop camera. It uses OpenCV for image processing and contour detection.

## Features
- Real-time shape detection.
- Supports laptop cameras or external cameras.
- Draws contours around detected shapes.
- Displays the name of the detected shape above it.
- Easy to add new shapes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision library.
- **NumPy**: Numerical processing for images.

## How to Run
1. **Install Requirements:**
   Make sure to install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
 
2. **Download the Code:**
   Download the code from the repository or clone it to your machine.

3. **Run the Program:**
   Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python shape_detection.py
   ```

4. **Using the Program:**
   - A window will open showing the camera feed.
   - Shapes will be detected, and contours will be drawn around them.
   - Press the `q` key to close the program.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
